Hi there!

I am Hassaan Bin Aslam, and welcome to my blog.

I started this blog to document and share my knowledge. I make a living by working as a Machine Learning Solutions Architect. AI/ML, Cloud Architecture, DevOps are fascinating topics and also close to my heart. Every day I face exciting problems, and I like to share my adventures here. I am passionate about AWS as a strategic cloud platform and using AI/ML to solve business problems. Iâ€™m currently focusing a lot of my time on applying DevOps practices to Machine Learning workloads (MLOps) to enable customers to adopt Machine Learning at scale.
