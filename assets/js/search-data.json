            "title": "AWS IAM Policy Types",
            "content": "About . Access is managed in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. . A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines their permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied. Most policies are stored in AWS as JSON documents. . AWS supports six types of policies: identity-based policies, resource-based policies, permissions boundaries, Organizations SCPs, ACLs, and session policies. This post is summary of AWS IAM policy and permission types. . AWS Policy Types . Identity-based policies . Identity-based policies – Attach managed and inline policies to IAM identities (users, groups to which users belong, or roles). Identity-based policies grant permissions to an identity. . Resource-based policies . Resource-based policies – Attach inline policies to resources. The most common examples of resource-based policies are Amazon S3 bucket policies and IAM role trust policies. Resource-based policies grant permissions to the principal that is specified in the policy. Principals can be in the same account as the resource or in other accounts. . Identity vs Resource based policy . . Identity-based policies are applied to IAM identities, and grant them access to AWS resources. | Resource-based policies are applied to AWS resources, and they grant access to Principals (IAM identities, and applications) | . Permissions boundaries . Permissions boundaries – Use a managed policy as the permissions boundary for an IAM entity (user or role). That policy defines the maximum permissions that the identity-based policies can grant to an entity, but does not grant permissions. Permissions boundaries do not define the maximum permissions that a resource-based policy can grant to an entity. . Organizations SCPs . Organizations SCPs – Use an AWS Organizations service control policy (SCP) to define the maximum permissions for account members of an organization or organizational unit (OU). SCPs limit permissions that identity-based policies or resource-based policies grant to entities (users or roles) within the account, but do not grant permissions. . Permission boundries vs Organization SCP . Both permission boundries and SCP only limit permissions. They don&#39;t give any permissions. | Permission boundries limits permissions of identity-based policies only. | SCP limits permissions on both identity and resource based policies. | . Access control lists (ACLs) . Access control lists (ACLs) – Use ACLs to control which principals in other accounts can access the resource to which the ACL is attached. ACLs are similar to resource-based policies, although they are the only policy type that does not use the JSON policy document structure. ACLs are cross-account permissions policies that grant permissions to the specified principal. ACLs cannot grant permissions to entities within the same account. . ACL vs Resource based policy . Resource based policies can grant permission to entities in same or different account | ACL can only grant permissions to entities in different account | Only a few resources support ACL including AWS Amazon S3, AWS WAF, and Amazon VPC. It is a legacy IAM policy type and AWS recommends not to use it. | . Session policies . Session policies – Pass advanced session policies when you use the AWS CLI or AWS API to assume a role or a federated user. Session policies limit the permissions that the role or user&#39;s identity-based policies grant to the session. Session policies limit permissions for a created session, but do not grant permissions. For more information, see Session Policies. .",

            "title": "AWS DNS Records - A, CNAME, ALIAS, & MX",
            "content": "About . This post summarizes the differences between AWS Route53 DNS records namely A record, CNAME, ALIAS, and MX. Knowledge about these differences is commonly checked in AWS certifications. . Credits . This post takes help from a few other really good articles. Please refer to them if need more details on this subject . “Demystifying DNS Records – A, CNAME, ALIAS, MX &amp; AAAA” from Whizlabs (https://www.whizlabs.com/blog/dns-records/) . | “Why a domain’s root can’t be a CNAME — and other tidbits about the DNS” from freeCodeCamp (https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c/) . | . A Record . A record (or an address record) always points to an IP address. This IP address should be static like AWS Elastic IP Addresses (EIP) . Example use cases . You can point your root domain name (also known as domain apex or naked domain) example.com to an Elastic IP Address 192.0.2.23 . | We can also map EC2 instances IPv4 Public IP Address to an A record. But this is not recommended as EC2 instances public IP addresses change when you stop/start your server. We should always use Elastic IP addresses instead. . | . AAAA Record . AAAA record is similar to A record but for IPv6 addresses. . It always points to an IPv6 address . | Note that AWS currently does not support EIP for IPv6 (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html) . | . MX Record . MX records (Mail Exchange records) are used for setting up email servers. . CNAME Record . CNAME records must always point to another domain name, never directly to an IP address. Since it does not point to an IP address, it is commonly used along with an A record. . One can, for example, point ftp.example.com and/or www.example.com to the DNS entry example.com, which in turn has an A record that points to the IP address. Then, if the IP address ever changes, one only has to record the change in one place within the network: in the DNS A record for example.com. . Example use cases . NAME TYPE VALUE . www.example.com | CNAME | example.com | . example.com | A | 192.0.2.23 | . An A record for example.com (root domain) points to server IP address . | A CNAME record points www.example.com to example.com . | . Now if the IP address of your server has changed you will have to update it only at one place A record. www.example.com and example.com will automatically inherit the changes. . IMPORTANT . CNAME entry for the root domain is not allowed. . | . NAME TYPE VALUE . example.com | CNAME | app.example.com | . app.example.com | A | 192.0.2.23 | . Alias Record . It is AWS Route 53 specific and only works with it. Alias works similar to CNAME but they are created by AWS to solve their specific problems discussed next. . AWS S3 buckets, Elastic Load Balancers, Elastic Beanstalk, and CloudFront offer you DNS names only and no IP addresses. e.g. when you create an S3 bucket you will get its DNS name bucket_name.s3.amazonaws.com. Now if you want to map your root domain example.com to S3 bucket DNS then we don’t have any options left as . A record points to IP addresses only . | CNAME cannot be used for root domain name . | . For this AWS came up with an Alias record in Route 53. With Alias record, you can point your domain root to another DNS name entry. . NAME TYPE VALUE . www.example.com | CNAME | example.com | . example.com | Alias | bucket_name.s3.amazonaws.com | .",

            "title": "Python - Getting more information from Tracebacks",
            "content": "About . This notebook demonstrates what the Python Traceback object is, and how can we get more information out of it to better diagnose exception messages. . Credit . This blog post is based on an article originally written in Python Cookbook published by O&#39;Reilly Media, Inc. and released July 2002. In book&#39;s chapter 15, there is a section with the title Getting More Information from Tracebacks written by Bryn Keller. An online version of this article is available at https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/python-cookbook/0596001673/ch14s05.html. . The original article uses Python 2.2, but I have adapted it for Python 3.8. Also, I have added some commentary to give more insights on Python Traceback object. . Environment Details . from platform import python_version print(&quot;python==&quot; + python_version()) . . python==3.8.5 . Discussion . Consider the following toy example where we are getting some data from an external source (an API call, a DB call, etc.), and we need to find the length of individual items provided in the list. We know that items in the list will be of type str so we have used a len() function on it. . We got an exception when we ran our function on received data, and now we are trying to investigate what caused the error. . # this is intentionally hidden as we don&#39;t know about the data received from an external source. data = [&quot;1&quot;, &quot;22&quot;, 333, &quot;4444&quot;] . . # our toy example function. import sys, traceback def get_items_len(items: list) -&gt; list: &quot;&quot;&quot; this function returns the length of items received in a list. &quot;&quot;&quot; items_len = [] for i in items: items_len.append(len(i)) return items_len . # let&#39;s run our function on &quot;data&quot; received from an external source try: get_items_len(data) except Exception as e: print(traceback.print_exc()) .

We got an exception while data processing and the Traceback message gives us some details. It tells us that we have received some data of type integer instead of string, and we are trying to call len() function on it. But we don&#39;t know the actual data value that caused the exception, and we don&#39;t know the index of the item in the list that caused this error. Depending on the use case, information about the local variables, or input data that caused the error can be crucial in diagnosing the root cause of an error. . Fortunately, all this information is already available to us in the Traceback object, but there are no built-in methods that give this information directly. Let us try some of the built-in methods on the Traceback object to see the kind of information we could get from them. . # calling traceback module built-in methods try: get_items_len(data) except Exception as e: print(&quot;***** Exception *****&quot;) print(e) exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback = sys.exc_info() print(&quot; n***** print_tb *****&quot;) traceback.print_tb(exc_traceback, limit=1, file=sys.stdout) print(&quot; n***** print_exception *****&quot;) # exc_type below is ignored on 3.5 and later traceback.print_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback, limit=2, file=sys.stdout) print(&quot; n***** print_exc *****&quot;) traceback.print_exc(limit=2, file=sys.stdout) print(&quot; n***** format_exc, first and last line *****&quot;) formatted_lines = traceback.format_exc().splitlines() print(formatted_lines[0]) print(formatted_lines[-1]) print(&quot; n***** format_exception *****&quot;) # exc_type below is ignored on 3.5 and later print(repr(traceback.format_exception(exc_type, exc_value, exc_traceback))) print(&quot; n***** extract_tb *****&quot;) print(repr(traceback.extract_tb(exc_traceback))) print(&quot; n***** format_tb *****&quot;) print(repr(traceback.format_tb(exc_traceback))) print(&quot; n***** tb_lineno *****&quot;, exc_traceback.tb_lineno) . ***** Exception ***** object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() ***** print_tb ***** File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; get_items_len(data) ***** print_exception ***** Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; get_items_len(data) File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-3-8421f841ba77&gt;&#34;, line 11, in get_items_len items_len.append(len(i)) TypeError: object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() ***** print_exc ***** Traceback (most recent call last): File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; get_items_len(data) File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-3-8421f841ba77&gt;&#34;, line 11, in get_items_len items_len.append(len(i)) TypeError: object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() ***** format_exc, first and last line ***** Traceback (most recent call last): TypeError: object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() ***** format_exception ***** [&#39;Traceback (most recent call last): n&#39;, &#39; File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; n get_items_len(data) n&#39;, &#39; File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-3-8421f841ba77&gt;&#34;, line 11, in get_items_len n items_len.append(len(i)) n&#39;, &#34;TypeError: object of type &#39;int&#39; has no len() n&#34;] ***** extract_tb ***** [&lt;FrameSummary file &lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;, line 4 in &lt;module&gt;&gt;, &lt;FrameSummary file &lt;ipython-input-3-8421f841ba77&gt;, line 11 in get_items_len&gt;] ***** format_tb ***** [&#39; File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-5-73d5b316a567&gt;&#34;, line 4, in &lt;module&gt; n get_items_len(data) n&#39;, &#39; File &#34;&lt;ipython-input-3-8421f841ba77&gt;&#34;, line 11, in get_items_len n items_len.append(len(i)) n&#39;] ***** tb_lineno ***** 4 . . All these methods are useful but we are still short on information about the state of local variables when the system crashed. Before writing our custom function to get the variables state at the time of exception, let us spend some time to understand the working of Traceback object. . Traceback Module . https://docs.python.org/3/library/traceback.html This module provides an easy-to-use interface to work with traceback objects. It provides multiple functions that we can use to extract the required information from traceback. So far, we have used methods from this module in the above examples. . Traceback Objects . https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html &gt; On this page search for term &quot;Traceback objects&quot; . Traceback objects represent a stack trace of an exception. A traceback object is implicitly created when an exception occurs and may also be explicitly created by initializing an instance of class types.TracebackType. traceback object is also an instance of types.TracebackType class. When an exception occurs, a traceback object is initialized for us, and we can obtain it from any of the following two methods. . It is available as a third item of the tuple returned by sys.exc_info() &quot;(type, value, traceback)&quot; | It is available as the __traceback__ object of the caught exception. &quot;Exception.__traceback__&quot; | A traceback object is a linked list of nodes, where each node is a Frame object. Frame objects form their own linked list but in the opposite direction of traceback objects. Together they work like a doubly-linked list, and we can use them to move back and forth in the stack trace history. It is the frame objects that hold all the stack&#39;s important information. traceback object has some special attributes . tb_next point to the next level in the stack trace (towards the frame where the exception occurred), or None if there is no next level | tb_frame points to the execution frame of the current level | tb_lineno gives the line number where the exception occurred | . # method 1: get traceback object using sys.exc_info() try: get_items_len(data) except Exception as e: print(sys.exc_info()[2]) . &lt;traceback object at 0x7f5c6c60e9c0&gt; . # method 2: get traceback object using Exception.__traceback__ try: get_items_len(data) except Exception as e: print(e.__traceback__ ) . &lt;traceback object at 0x7f5c6c5c0180&gt; . If there is no exception in the system, then calling sys.exc_info() will only return None values. . # no exception is generated so sys.exc_info() will return None values. try: get_items_len([&#39;1&#39;,&#39;2&#39;,&#39;3&#39;,&#39;4&#39;]) except Exception as e: print(sys.exc_info()[2]) . Frame Objects . https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html &gt; On this page search for term &quot;Frame objects&quot; . Frame objects represent execution frames. It has some special attributes . f_back is a reference to the previous stack frame (towards the caller), or None if this is the bottom stack frame | f_code is the code object being executed in this frame. We will discuss Code Objects in next the section | f_lineno is the current line number of the frame — writing to this from within a trace function jumps to the given line (only for the bottom-most frame). A debugger can implement a Jump command (aka Set Next Statement) by writing to f_lineno. This attribute will give you the line number in the code on which exception occurred | f_locals is a dictionary used to lookup local variables. From this dictionary we can get all the local variables and their state at the time of exception | f_globals is a dictionary for global varaibles | . Code Objects . https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html &gt; On this page search for term &quot;Code Objects&quot; . Code objects represent byte-compiled executable Python code or bytecode. Some of its attributes include . co_name gives the function name being executed | co_filename gives the filename from which the code was compiled | . There are many other helpful attributes in this object, and you may read about them from the docs. . Visual representation of Traceback, Frame and Code Objects . figure 1: Visual representation of Traceback, Frame and Code Objects . Custom fuction for additional exception info . Now with this additional information on stack trace objects, let us create a function to get variables state at the time of exception. . def exc_info_plus(): &quot;&quot;&quot; Provides the usual traceback information, followed by a listing of all the local variables in each frame. &quot;&quot;&quot; tb = sys.exc_info()[2] # iterate forward to the last (most recent) traceback object. while 1: if not tb.tb_next: break tb = tb.tb_next stack = [] # get the most recent traceback frame f = tb.tb_frame # iterate backwards from recent to oldest traceback frame while f: stack.append(f) f = f.f_back # stack.reverse() # uncomment to get innermost (most recent) frame at the last # get exception information and stack trace entries from most recent traceback object exc_msg = traceback.format_exc() exc_msg += &quot; n*** Locals by frame, innermost first ***&quot; for frame in stack: exc_msg += f&quot; nFrame {frame.f_code.co_name} in {frame.f_code.co_filename} at line {frame.f_lineno}&quot; for key, value in frame.f_locals.items(): exc_msg += f&quot; n t {key:20} = &quot; try: data = str(value) # limit variable&#39;s output to a certain number.

            "title": "Python Dictionary - Multiple ways to get items",
            "content": "About . This notebook demonstrates multiple ways to get items from a Python dictionary. . Environment Details . from platform import python_version print(&quot;python==&quot; + python_version()) . . python==3.8.5 . Example Dictionaries . # simple dictionary car = { &quot;brand&quot;: &quot;ford&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;mustang&quot; } car . {&#39;brand&#39;: &#39;ford&#39;, &#39;model&#39;: &#39;mustang&#39;} . # nested dictionary family = { &#39;gfather&#39; : { &#39;father&#39;: { &#39;son&#39;: {&#39;love&#39;:&#39;python&#39;} } } } family . {&#39;gfather&#39;: {&#39;father&#39;: {&#39;son&#39;: {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;}}}} . Method 1: Square brackets . A square bracket is the simplest approach to getting any item from a dictionary. You can get a value from a dictionary by providing it a key in [] brackets. For example, to get a value of model from a car . car[&#39;model&#39;] . &#39;mustang&#39; . Problem with this approach is that if the provided key is not available in the dictionary then it will throw a KeyError exception. . car[&#39;year&#39;] . KeyErrorTraceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-5-ca220af55913&gt; in &lt;module&gt; -&gt; 1 car[&#39;year&#39;] KeyError: &#39;year&#39; . To avoid KeyError, you can first check if the key is available in dictionary. . if &#39;year&#39; in car: # check if given key is available in dictionary year = car[&#39;year&#39;] # now get the value else: year = &#39;1964&#39; # (Optional) otherwise give this car a default value year . &#39;1964&#39; . An alternate approach could be to use a Try-Except block to handle the KeyError exception. . try: year = car[&#39;year&#39;] except KeyError: year = &#39;1964&#39; # give this car a default value year . &#39;1964&#39; . For nested dictionaries, you can use chained [] brackets. But beware that if any of the Keys is missing in the chain, you will get a KeyError exception. . # this will work. All keys are present. family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;father&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] . {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;} . # this will not work. &#39;mother&#39; key is not in dictionary family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;mother&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] . KeyErrorTraceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-9-3d615db6bfdf&gt; in &lt;module&gt; 1 # this will not work. &#39;mother&#39; key is not in dictionary -&gt; 2 family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;mother&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] KeyError: &#39;mother&#39; . Method 2: Get function . https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get &gt; get(key[, default]) . Get function will return the value for key if key is in the dictionary. Otherwise, it will return a default value which is None. You can provide your default value as well. . year = car.get(&#39;year&#39;, &#39;1964&#39;) year # year key is not present so get function will return a default value &#39;1964&#39; . &#39;1964&#39; . Depending on your use case there can be confusion with this approach when your item can also have None value. In that case, you will not know whether the None value was returned from the dictionary or it was the Get function. . owner = car.get(&#39;owner&#39;) owner # owner has a None value. But is this value coming from dic or from Get function? # This can be confusing for large nested dictionaries. . For nested dictionaries you can use chained Get functions. But beware that missing Key items needs to be properly handled otherwise you will still get an exception. . # this will work. All keys are present. family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;father&#39;).get(&#39;son&#39;) . {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;} . # this will still work. &#39;daughter&#39; key is missing # but since it is at the end of chain it will return a default None value family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;father&#39;).get(&#39;daughter&#39;) . # this will NOT work. &#39;mother&#39; key is missing and it returned a default None value. # but since it is not at the end, and we called Get function on returned value &#39;None&#39; family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;mother&#39;).get(&#39;son&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code .
