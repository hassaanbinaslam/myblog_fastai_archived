            "title": "Python Dictionary - Multiple ways to get items",
            "content": "About . This notebook demonstrates multiple ways to get items from a Python dictionary. . Environment Details . from platform import python_version print(&quot;python==&quot; + python_version()) . . python==3.8.5 . Example Dictionaries . # simple dictionary car = { &quot;brand&quot;: &quot;ford&quot;, &quot;model&quot;: &quot;mustang&quot; } car . {&#39;brand&#39;: &#39;ford&#39;, &#39;model&#39;: &#39;mustang&#39;} . # nested dictionary family = { &#39;gfather&#39; : { &#39;father&#39;: { &#39;son&#39;: {&#39;love&#39;:&#39;python&#39;} } } } family . {&#39;gfather&#39;: {&#39;father&#39;: {&#39;son&#39;: {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;}}}} . Method 1: Square brackets . A square bracket is the simplest approach to getting any item from a dictionary. You can get a value from a dictionary by providing it a key in [] brackets. For example, to get a value of model from a car . car[&#39;model&#39;] . &#39;mustang&#39; . Problem with this approach is that if the provided key is not available in the dictionary then it will throw a KeyError exception. . car[&#39;year&#39;] . KeyErrorTraceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-5-ca220af55913&gt; in &lt;module&gt; -&gt; 1 car[&#39;year&#39;] KeyError: &#39;year&#39; . To avoid KeyError, you can first check if the key is already available in the dictionary. . if &#39;year&#39; in car: # check if given key is available in dictionary year = car[&#39;year&#39;] # now get the value else: year = &#39;1964&#39; # (Optional) otherwise give this car a default value year . &#39;1964&#39; . An alternate approach could be to use a Try-Except block to handle the KeyError exception. . try: year = car[&#39;year&#39;] except KeyError: year = &#39;1964&#39; # give this car a default value year . &#39;1964&#39; . For nested dictionaries, you can use chained [] brackets. But beware that if any of the Keys is missing in the chain, you will get a KeyError exception. . # this will work. All keys are present. family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;father&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] . {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;} . # this will not work. &#39;mother&#39; key is not in dictionary family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;mother&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] . KeyErrorTraceback (most recent call last) &lt;ipython-input-9-3d615db6bfdf&gt; in &lt;module&gt; 1 # this will not work. &#39;mother&#39; key is not in dictionary -&gt; 2 family[&#39;gfather&#39;][&#39;mother&#39;][&#39;son&#39;] KeyError: &#39;mother&#39; . Method 2: Get function . https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#dict.get &gt; get(key[, default]) . Get function will return the value for key if key is in the dictionary. Otherwise, it will return a default value which is None. You can provide your default value as well. . year = car.get(&#39;year&#39;, &#39;1964&#39;) year # year key is not present so get function will return a default value &#39;1964&#39; . &#39;1964&#39; . Depending on your use case there can be confusion with this approach when your item can also have None value. In that case, you will not know whether the None value was returned from the dictionary or it was the Get function. . owner = car.get(&#39;owner&#39;) owner # owner has a None value. But is this value coming from dic or from Get function? # This can be confusing for large nested dictionaries. . For nested dictionaries you can use chained Get functions. But beware that missing Key items needs to be properly handled otherwise you will still get an exception. . # this will work. All keys are present. family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;father&#39;).get(&#39;son&#39;) . {&#39;love&#39;: &#39;python&#39;} . # this will still work. &#39;daughter&#39; key is missing # but since it is at the end of chain it will return a default None value family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;father&#39;).get(&#39;daughter&#39;) . # this will NOT work. &#39;mother&#39; key is missing and it returned a default None value. # but since it is not at the end, and we called Get function on returned value &#39;None&#39; family.get(&#39;gfather&#39;).get(&#39;mother&#39;).get(&#39;son&#39;) .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
