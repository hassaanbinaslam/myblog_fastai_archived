Factorization machines are a good choice for tasks dealing with high dimensional sparse datasets, such as click prediction and item recommendation.\n",

This metric can be calculated by taking the total number of documents, dividing it by the number of documents that contain a word, and calculating the logarithm. So, if the word is very common and appears in many documents, this number will approach 0. Otherwise, it will approach 1\n",

You can use an inference pipeline to combine preprocessing, predictions, and post-processing data science tasks. Inference pipelines are fully managed.\n",

You start with a machine learning model already built with DarkNet, Keras, MXNet, PyTorch, TensorFlow, TensorFlow-Lite, ONNX, or XGBoost and trained in Amazon SageMaker or anywhere else. Then you choose your target hardware platform, which can be a SageMaker hosting instance or an edge device based on processors from Ambarella, Apple, ARM, Intel, MediaTek, Nvidia, NXP, Qualcomm, RockChip, Texas Instruments, or Xilinx. With a single click, SageMaker Neo optimizes the trained model and compiles it into an executable. The compiler uses a machine learning model to apply the performance optimizations that extract the best available performance for your model on the cloud instance or edge device. You then deploy the model as a SageMaker endpoint or on supported edge devices and start making predictions.\n",

Tagging is fundamental for understanding scenes, which is critical to an increasing number of computer vision applications, such as self-driving vehicles, medical imaging diagnostics, and robot sensing.\n",

    "For comparison, the SageMaker Image Classification Algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that analyzes only whole images, classifying them into one of multiple output categories. The Object Detection Algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm that detects and classifies all instances of an object in an image. It indicates the location and scale of each object in the image with a rectangular bounding box.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because the semantic segmentation algorithm classifies every pixel in an image, it also provides information about the shapes of the objects contained in the image.

    "L1 regularization, also known as L1 norm or Lasso (in regression problems), combats overfitting by shrinking the parameters towards 0. This makes some features obsolete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Itâ€™s a form of feature selection, because when we assign a feature with a 0 weight, weâ€™re multiplying the feature values by 0 which returns 0, eradicating the significance of that feature. If the input features of our model have weights closer to 0, our L1 norm would be sparse. A selection of the input features would have weights equal to zero, and the rest would be non-zero. \n",

    "## L2 regularization\n",
    "L2 regularization, or the L2 norm, or Ridge (in regression problems), combats overfitting by forcing weights to be small, but not making them exactly 0.

A major snag to consider when using L2 regularization is that itâ€™s not robust to outliers. \n",
